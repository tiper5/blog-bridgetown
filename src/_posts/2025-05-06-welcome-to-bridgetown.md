Today we started working with the `Bridgetown` environment. Since we are just beginning our journey with Bridgetown during our internship, we first had to set up the right environment to start learning and working with this tool. We installed the following applications: `Ruby`, `Node.js`, `Yarn`, `Git`, `Bridgetown CLI`, and `Visual Studio Code`.

Because Bridgetown only works on `Linux` and `macOS`, and we are using `Windows`, we had to install `Ubuntu on Windows (WSL – Windows Subsystem for Linux)`. This was our first challenge – but we managed to overcome it quickly.

During the installation process, we encountered a few more issues – some applications didn’t work correctly at first. We had to deepen our knowledge and search for solutions in the documentation and online forums. In the end, we were able to configure everything properly.

Despite the difficulties, we’re happy that we got to learn something completely new and solve real technical problems. It was a valuable lesson that will definitely benefit us in the future.
