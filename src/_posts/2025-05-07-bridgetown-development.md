## 🛠️ Work Progress with `Bridgetown`

Today we continued working with the `Bridgetown` environment.  
At the beginning of the day we started reading documentation about customizing our projects.

We read about:
- `Folder Structures`
- `Resources`
- `Front Matter`
- `Layouts`
- `Customize Your Site`

We found it very interesting and started implementing this to our own projects.
