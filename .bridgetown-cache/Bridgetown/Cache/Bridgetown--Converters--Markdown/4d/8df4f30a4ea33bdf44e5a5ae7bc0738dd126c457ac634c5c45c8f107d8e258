I"Ä<p>Today we started working with Tailwind framework. Firstly I used this command bin/bridgetown apply https://github.com/Munkun-Estudio/tailwindcss-automation to download Tailwind framework. At first it didnâ€™t work but when I updated packages everything installed properly. Then I watched a Tailwind CSS Tutorial and applied some small changes into my website. Lastly I added UI blocks to my page and adjusted them to fit my page and added text.</p>
